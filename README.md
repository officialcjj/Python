# Python

These are my Python web applications (mostly made with sqlite3, tkinter, and/or django)

## This is where I'll keep all my Python projects
## Check them out:

* [University and Student DB App](https://github.com/officialcjj/Python/tree/main/DjangoUniversity)
* [Hangman](https://github.com/officialcjj/Python/blob/main/Hangman.py)
* [Checkbook](https://github.com/officialcjj/Python/tree/main/Django_Checkbook_Project)

## University and Student DB App
Can create and store university and student objects.

## Hangman
A simple guessing game.

## Checkbook
A simple checkbook application that can create user objects and 
track their deposits, withdrawals, and balance 
as well as logging the dates of transactions for future references.
